## Description
Shinsen San was really good at making sushi, so good in fact that the Yakuza asked him to serve him the deadly fugu fish one evening. Alas he messed up and ended up poisoning himself and all the Yakuza who he served.
Now the ghosts of the Yakuza in the afterlife are irate and want revenge on Shinsen San's family who are gathering for the funeral at his home. It is up to Shinsen San to use his own ghostly powers to protect his home and his family as they attend the funeral and leave over the course of the day.
